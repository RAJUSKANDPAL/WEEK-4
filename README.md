# WEEK-4
This repository contains a detailed 📄 R&D document on Azure Virtual Network (VNet), focusing on CIDR ranges, subnets, and VNet peering 🔗. It explains the fundamentals of Azure networking, including IP address planning and the different types of VNet peering (Basic and Global) 🌐. The project also includes a practical hands-on use case where a VNet is created with multiple subnets, and both Windows 🪟 and Linux 🐧 virtual machines are deployed in separate subnets. These VMs are configured to successfully communicate with each other via ping ✅. Additionally, the setup involves creating two separate VNets and connecting them using VNet peering, followed by testing cross-VNet communication 🔧. The entire process is documented with step-by-step explanations and screenshots 📸 taken directly from the Azure Portal ☁️.
